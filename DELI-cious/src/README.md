# ðŸ¥ª DELI-cious â€“ Capstone Java CLI Ordering App

**Build Your Sandwich, Byte by Byte!**

DELI-cious is a command-line Java application that simulates a point-of-sale system for a sandwich shop. Users can create customized sandwich orders, add drinks and chips, and save receipts. This project demonstrates solid object-oriented programming (OOP) practices, designed as part of my Java OOP capstone at Year Up.

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation** â€” Order, Sandwich, Topping classes
- **Composition** â€” Sandwich contains toppings, sauces, etc.
- **Separation of Concerns** â€” `UserInterface` handles interaction, `Order` manages data
- **Polymorphism / Inheritance** â€” Signature sandwiches (if implemented)

## âœ¨ Special Code Highlight

```java
System.out.print("Would you like to make it a combo? (yes/no): ");
if (scanner.nextLine().equalsIgnoreCase("yes")) {
    displayDrinkOptions(order);
    displayChipOptions(order);
}
